I'm trying to set here to my private dictionary about many languages or etc.

If you want to know what I'm doing and I'm interested in, here is my notion link : <https://bit.ly/notionPJE>

`ND is initials of Nano Degree bootcamp in Learning Spoons Academy. It had been last from Nov 8 2021 to Feb 28 2022. All of camp members were very smart and friendly. So If you want to search other talented people, I recommend you to hunt in my followers list! 😉`
